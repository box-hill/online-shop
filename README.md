# Online Shop
An online shop (front-end only) where users can view, add and remove items in their shopping cards.  

One of the goals of this website is to make it feel as modern as possible.  
Whatever you're trying to sell on a website, there's always multiple 'angles/perspective' of an item.  
Take for example, an umbrella has a closed and open state.  Customers should be able to view both states easily without having to click on an item.
